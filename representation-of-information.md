# ðŸ§­ Represenation of Information

![Program's POV of Memory](assets/images/representation-of-information/program's-pov-of-memory.webp)

**Note:**

- A machine level program views memory as a very large array of bytes, reffered to as **virtual memory**.
- Every byte of the memory is identified by a unique number (represented in hex) called **address**.
- The set of all these possible addresses is known as the **virtual address space**.
